# MobiStore
This is the React + TailwindCSS frontend for the EaaS project.

## Project Description
The frontend provides a simple dashboard for small business owners to manage their products, prices, images, and stock. Once products are added, they are automatically linked with the backend and can be accessed by customers through WhatsApp. The dashboard allows owners to track inventory, view customer orders, and stay in control of their WhatsApp shop.

## Purpose / Goal
The goal of this project is to empower small businesses to quickly set up and manage their e-commerce presence through WhatsApp, without needing advanced technical knowledge or a full website. The frontend focuses on usability, speed, and clarity, making it easy for business owners to get started and grow.
